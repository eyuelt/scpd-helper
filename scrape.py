This program downloads scpd videos for a given class in the order
that they happened as a wmv, then converts them to a mp4. Each time 
the script is run, it will update to download all of the undownloaded
videos. 

This script is modified from the one by Jeremy Keeshin (https://github.com/jkeesh),
which itself was modified from the one by Ben Newhouse (https://github.com/newhouseb).

Unfortunately, there are lots of dependencies to get it up and running
1. Handbrake CLI, for converting to mp4: http://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php
2. BeautifulSoup for parsing: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
3. Mechanize for emulating a browser, http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

Usage: python scrape.py [Stanford ID] "Interactive Computer Graphics"

The way I use it is to keep a folder of videos, and once I have watched them, move them
into a subfolder called watched. So it also wont redownload files that are in a subfolder
called watched.
